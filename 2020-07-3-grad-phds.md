This past May, two Ph.D. candidates from the Secure Systems Lab,  Santiago Torres-Arias and Daniel Gopstein, successfully defended their dissertations and were awarded their Ph.D.s. While we are excited about this milestone in their lives, there is no doubt they will be missed. Not only did each make significant research contributions to SSL projects during their stay, but both could also be relied on as resources for others in the lab. Santiago was always quick to chime in when others mentioned particular research challenges in their progress reports. Dan not only set up, and for many years maintained, our SSL website, but also offered assistance more than once for those interpreting and analyzing data from human subject user studies. (On a strictly personal note, both of them also rescued me from some self-inflicted LaTex wounds in my early days of working on GitHub, for which I am eternally grateful.)

Before leaving NYU Tandon, both Santiago and Dan shared some thoughts on their time at the lab.  In separate interviews they talked about what brought them to the lab, some high and low points of the experience, and what lessons were learned along the way.
