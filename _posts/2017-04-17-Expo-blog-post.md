The Research Expo at the NYU Tandon School of Engineering is a showcase where
students and faculty alike can share their current research activities with
the greater academic community, and with the general public. The event is
held outdoors and is designed to be interactive and enjoyable for people
from all levels of scientific and technological expertise.

This year the Expo will be held on April 21 from 1 to 4:00 p.m.
Among the 60-plus exhibits—featuring work drawn from every academic department
at the school—will be presentations on two sprouting projects from the
Secure Systems Lab. Undergraduate researcher <a href="/people#lolaly_luo">Shuyuan Luo</a>
and Ph.D. candidate
<a href="/people#santiago_torres">Santiago Torres-Arias</a> will present their
ongoing work on [PolyPasswordHasher](https://polypasswordhasher.github.io/PolyPasswordHasher/)
(PPH), a secure password storage system. In addition to a basic introduction
to PPH, they will be spotlighting their work on
[PAM](https://github.com/LolalyLuo/PolyPasswordHasher/tree/PPHPAMModule)(Pluggable
Authentication Module). Developed last summer, and already widely used
in both Linux and OS X systems, PAM offers operating systems a
simple way to “plug in” to the enhanced security benefits of PPH,
without requiring any extensive modifications.

The other SSL representative presenting at the Expo will be second year Ph.D.
student <a href="/people#preston_moore">Preston Moore</a>, who will be sharing
his work on <a href="/projects#CrashSimulator">CrashSimulator</a>.
This tool replicates “real-world” testing for new and upgraded software
without the complications of “real-world” deployment.

The Expo is free, but attendees are asked to [register](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/2017-nyu-tandon-school-of-engineering-research-expo-general-public-viewing-registration-33122091066).
