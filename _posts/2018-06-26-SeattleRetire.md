Ten years ago, I (Justin Cappos) wrote the first few lines of code in a Python
based sandbox called Repy, intended for use in a new peer-to-peer cloud
environment.  This started a project that featured code contributions from
over 100 participants, was used by over four thousand developers, and was
installed on tens of thousands of devices.  

Seattle provided students, developers, and educators a chance to 
run code on different computers, phones, and servers around the world.
This was often used to relay traffic from a foreign location, giving
students the opportunity to explore how the Internet's performance varies
from different parts of the world.

Due to the tireless effort of many students to improve Seattle's ease of
use and pedogical value, the Seattle Testbed was featured in many papers and 
given a number of awards.  Student contributions, in particular 
undergraduates, always played a heavy role in Seattle's growth.  This 
includes many students who won prestigious awards for their research 
(multiple CRA Outstanding Researcher and NSF Fellowship Awards), students 
who got top industry jobs (at Microsoft, Facebook, Google, Apple, etc.), 
even some who founded their own company (including Justin Samuel, who 
founded ServerPilot and Armon Dadgar and Mitchell Hashimoto, co-founders 
of Hashicorp).   

Of course, graduate students and senior researchers also played a major role.  
Among the PhD students, Ivan Beschastnikh (now a professor at UBC), created 
the first version of the Seattle clearinghouse.  Albert Rafetseder did a lot 
of research using the Seattle testbed as a PhD student and later became the 
lead for the Seattle Testbed.  His efforts were not only essential for
keeping the testbed running, but also helped to grow and strengthen the
platform.


Notable amongst the uses of Seattle testbed was the creation of Sensibility
Testbed.  Yanyan Zhuang (now a professor of UCCS), led the Sensibility Testbed
project, a sensor-focused, smartphone variant of Seattle that uses much of 
its codebase.  Sensibility testbed has been the subject of many successful
hack-a-thons and has been an enjoyable project to work on.  However, with
Seattle being retired, Sensibility also will not be continued.

While Seattle (and Sensibility) will still be supported and used in the 
classroom, no substantial development will be done other than bug fixes.
We appreciate the dozens of instructors that used Seattle (in about 100
classes), the thousands of developers that built applications, and the
thousands of students that used Seattle in the classroom.  Thank you all
for your support!
